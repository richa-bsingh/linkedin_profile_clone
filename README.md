## üìñ Usage

### Customizing Profile Data

The profile data is stored in the `profileData` object within `App.tsx`. You can modify this object to display your own information:

```typescript
const profileData = {
  name: "Your Name",
  headline: "Your Professional Headline",
  location: "Your Location",
  // ... other profile data
};
```

### Adding New Sections

To add a new section:

1. Add a new key to the `TabContent` object
2. Create the corresponding component
3. Add an icon to the `TabIcons` object
4. The navigation will automatically update

### Modifying Styles

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. To modify styles:

1. Use Tailwind classes directly in components
2. Customize `tailwind.config.js` for theme changes
3. Add custom CSS in `index.css` if needed
